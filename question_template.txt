Are there any potential attribute errors in the code due to method calls?
Specifically, check for possible attribute errors related to <attribute-nodes>.
If any such errors may occur, propose modifications to prevent them.

Are all these <functions-name>  already defined in python or in this code ?
if not give an implementation of the one non existing.
